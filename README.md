# cGAN_DEAP_Dataset
Implementation of GAN network to generate EEG labeled data from DEAP dataset
This code is written generic and is able to produce a vector of features with any given size.
In this example the number of extracted features from EEG signals is 344. 
So the GAN is going to produce a labeled data with 344 input features.
